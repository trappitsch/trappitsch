#### 🏗 Under development 🏗

 - [**iniabu**](https://github.com/galactic-forensics/iniabu):  
   Python API to interact with various solar abundances,
   calculate isotope ratios, etc. 
   *Want to test & propose ideas? Awesome!*  
   [Contact me](mailto:reto@galactic-forensics.space)
 - **Presolar grain database**:  
   Planning... Python API (later GUI as well) to interact
   with the new and updated [presolar grain database](https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2020/pdf/2140.pdf).

#### ✨ Some fun projects ✨
 - [**fbs with github actions**](https://github.com/trappitsch/fbs-release-github-actions):  
   Write a PyQt python program, package it with [fbs](https://build-system.fman.io),
   push to github, and actions take care of the packaging and releasing.
   For people like me that are too lazy to do it manually...
 - [**Coordinate Transformation**](https://github.com/trappitsch/CoordinateTransformation):
   Not my prettiest code, but functional.
   Transform coordinates for finding your samples again in different instruments.
 - [**Other fun project**](https://galactic-forensics.space/resources/links/):
   More stuff that I didn't write, check it out! 🔭
