#### ✨ Fun projects ✨
 - [**fbs with github actions**](https://github.com/trappitsch/fbs-release-github-actions):  
   Write a PyQt python program, package it with [fbs](https://build-system.fman.io),
   push to github, and actions take care of the packaging and releasing.
   For people like me that are too lazy to do it manually...
 - [**Coordinate Transformation**](https://github.com/trappitsch/CoordinateTransformation):
   Not my prettiest code, but functional.
   Transform coordinates for finding your samples again in different instruments.
 - [**Other fun projects**](https://galactic-forensics.space/resources/links/):
   More stuff that I didn't write, check it out! 🔭
